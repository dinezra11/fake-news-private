<p>
    The project's goal is to establish a system that will reduce the amount of fake news consumed by the readers.<br>
    We are building and training a deep learning model that will classify news articels as Fake or Legit.<br>
    In addition, we let experts to express their opinion on the model's predictions, so the readers will have extra confident in choosing
    whether to accept the AI judgement or not.

    for educational purposes only.
